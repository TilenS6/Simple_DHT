# Simple_DHT
Very simple, lightweight and fast C/C++ library for AVR Microcontrollers (Arduino)
Should be compatable with most DHT sensors (I was testing on DHT22)

# Installation
1. Download .zip from releases: https://github.com/TilenS6/Simple_DHT/releases
2. Go to Arduino IDE: Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library, then select downloaded .zip
